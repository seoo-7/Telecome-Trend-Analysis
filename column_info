# Column Explanations for `public.telecom_data`

This document provides clear definitions, usage contexts, and insights for key columns in the `public.telecom_data` table. All descriptions are in English.

---

## 1. LTE Accessibility
- **Definition:** The percentage of successful attempts by devices to connect to the 4G/LTE network. High values indicate strong user access to high-speed mobile internet.
- **Why It’s Useful:**  
  - Identifies coverage gaps where users struggle to obtain 4G service.  
  - Highlights areas needing additional antenna placement or capacity upgrades.
- **Sample Insight:**  
  - `Akron: 93.97%` means 6.03% of connection attempts failed initially.

---

## 2. LTE Retainability
- **Definition:** The network’s ability to maintain active LTE connections without unexpected drops (e.g., during streaming or calls).
- **Why It’s Useful:**  
  - Low retainability indicates frequent call drops or buffering issues.  
- **Sample Insight:**  
  - `Bristol: 99.05%` indicates excellent stability; only 0.95% of connections dropped.

---

## 3. LTE Same-Frequency Handover
- **Definition:** Success rate when a device switches between cell towers on the **same** frequency band.
- **When It Occurs:**  
  - Movement (walking/driving) through areas with towers broadcasting on identical frequencies.  
- **Why It Matters:**  
  - Low values can lead to call freezing, video buffering, or data interruption during local movement.

---

## 4. LTE Cross-Frequency Handover
- **Definition:** Success rate when a device switches between cell towers on **different** frequency bands.
- **When It Occurs:**  
  - Transitioning between coverage zones (e.g., city to suburbs).  
  - Entering buildings where different frequencies penetrate more effectively.

---

## 5. Network Availability
- **Definition:** Percentage of time the telecom network services are operational without outage.
- **Why It’s Useful:**  
  - Directly impacts customer satisfaction and SLA compliance.  
- **Sample Insight:**  
  - Regions below 99% may require infrastructure maintenance or redundancy improvements.

---

## 6. 4G VoLTE Accessibility
- **Definition:** The percentage of times devices successfully access VoLTE services when initiating a voice call over LTE.
- **Why It Matters:**  
  - Low values indicate gaps in voice-specific coverage or misconfigurations in the VoLTE core network.

---

## 7. VoLTE CSSR (Call Setup Success Rate)
- **Definition:** Percentage of VoLTE call setup attempts that complete successfully.
- **Why It Matters:**  
  - Directly impacts voice call quality and customer experience.  
  - Key failure points may include core congestion, IMS registration issues, or QoS mismatches.
